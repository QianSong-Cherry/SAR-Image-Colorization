* Datasets that used in the paper can be downloaded from https://www.asf.alaska.edu/ select UAVSAR data acquired at San Andreas fault.

## Prerequisites
- Python 2.7
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/install.html)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- h5py

## Useage
First, download dataset:

    $ Download the data(https://www.asf.alaska.edu/), and save it as *.mat* file. Two Images used in this paper are SanAnd_08503_12130_002_121109_L090_CX_01 and gulfco_00702_12053_004_120702_L090_CX_01.
    $  mkdir data
     ... and copy data into it.
     
To train a model:

    $ python main.py


## Results
### VV-pol SAR Image
